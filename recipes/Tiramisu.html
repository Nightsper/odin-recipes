    <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brew strong coffee, and sugar to taste, stir until the sugar is
        completely dissolved, and allow to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks. Add
        mascarpone cheese and sugar until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the whipped cream until well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 13" x 9" inch pan quickly soak each of the ladyfingers into the
        coffee syrup and assemble one layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half of the mascarpone cream on top of the ladyfingers creating a
        second layer. Follow steps 4 - 5 to create two more layers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4-5
        hours or better yet overnight to allow the mixture to solidify.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before serving, dust the top of the tiramisu with unsweetened cocoa
        powder using a fine sieve.
