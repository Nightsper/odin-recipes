    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Brew strong coffee, and add sugar to taste, stir until the sugar is
        completely dissolved, and allow to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a cold mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl add mascarpone cheese (or cream cheese) and sugar and
        mix until smooth
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the whipped cream until well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 13" x 9" inch pan quickly soak each of the ladyfingers into the
        coffee syrup and assemble one layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half of the mascarpone cream on top of the ladyfingers creating a
        second layer. Follow steps 4 - 5 to create two more layers.
      </li>

        powder using a fine sieve.
