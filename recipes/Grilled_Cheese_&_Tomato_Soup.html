      <h4 class="ts-steps">For the Tomato Soup</h4>
      <ol class="ts-steps">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C).</li>
        <li>
          Drizzle half of the olive oil onto the sheet tray, then add the cherry
          tomatoes, onion and garlic. Add the rest of the olive oil over top,
          then season generously with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the tomatoes have burst and begun to
          caramelize around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Add the tomatoes, onion, and garlic, as well as any juices on the
          sheet tray to a high powered blender. Blend on medium high for 1
          minute, or until fully pureed. Taste and season with additional salt,
          pepper, and sugar, if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the tomatoes are blending, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
          If more liquid is needed to thin the consistency of the soup, add half
          of the hot water to the sheet tray. Scrape up any browned bits with a
          wooden spoon or spatula. Carefully transfer that to the blender. If
          more is needed, add water in ¼ cup increments to the blender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the heavy cream and blend again for 20 seconds. If the mixture is
          too thick, add ¼ cup of water incrementally, or until the desired
          consistency is achieved.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4 class="gc-steps">For the Grilled Cheese</h4>
      <ol class="gc-steps">
        <li>
          On one side of each piece of bread, spread the mayonnaise and 1
          tablespoon of butter over the surface, all the way to the edges.
          Sprinkle ¼ cup of Parmesan evenly over the mayonnaise, and lightly
          press into the surface of the bread. Flip each piece over and add the
          cheddar, Gouda and fontina cheese to one piece of bread. Top with the
          second piece and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of
          butter. Once the butter is lightly sizzling, add the grilled cheese.
          Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until one side is deeply golden brown, then
          flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, cover the skillet with a lid to
          allow the grilled cheese to lightly steam and melt any cheese that has
          not yet melted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the grilled cheese from the pan and turn the heat to low. Add
          the remaining Parmesan cheese directly onto the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the grilled cheese back to the skillet, directly on top of the
          Parmesan. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the Parmesan is crispy and
          crunchy on the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer to a cutting board and let the grilled cheese cool for 2-3
          minutes. Once it is cool enough to handle, slice it in half and serve
          it with tomato soup.
        </li>
