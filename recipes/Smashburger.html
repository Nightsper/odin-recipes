    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>smashburger</b> is the ultimate way to enjoy a juicy, flavorful
      burger with a perfectly crispy crust. Unlike traditional burgers,
      smashburgers are made by pressing a ball of ground beef onto a hot
      griddle, creating a deep, caramelized sear that locks in juices. The
      result is a thin, crispy-edged patty that’s packed with bold, beefy
      flavor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Served on a soft bun with classic toppings like melted cheese, pickles,
      and a tangy sauce, a smashburger delivers the perfect balance of crunch,
      tenderness, and taste in every bite. Whether you're making it at home or
      ordering from your favorite burger spot, this method guarantees a
      deliciously satisfying experience.

    </ul>
    <h4>For Assembly:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
      <li>2 potato buns</li>
      <li>6 slices thin American cheese</li>
      <li>6 slices thin sharp white cheddar</li>
      <li>Pickle chips</li>
      <li>Bottled ketchup / mustard / special sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Special Sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped pickles</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pickle juice or vinegar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Divide the beef into 6 equal portions. Gently roll each portion into a
        ball and then pass the beef in between your hands, slapping it from one
        hand to the other to compress the ball and remove any excess air. Place
        the balls on a plate and place in the refrigerator, uncovered, to let
        the fat re-solidify.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the burgers are in the refrigerator, make the special sauce. In a
        small mixing bowl, add all of the ingredients and whisk well to combine.
        Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the burgers are ready to cook, preheat a large cast iron griddle or
        skillet over medium high heat. Add the oil to the griddle and once the
        oil is shimmering, add the bun top side down to the griddle. Cook for
        1-2 minutes, or until the top bun is a deeper golden brown. Remove from
        the griddle and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the top of three ground beef balls with salt. Add them to the
        still-hot griddle, then place a heavy burger press onto each patty,
        compressing it down to ¼ inch (.6 cm) thick. Cook each patty for 1
        minute, or until deeply golden brown and lacy. Season the other side of
        the burger with salt, then flip the patty and cook for 30 seconds. Turn
        off the heat and add 3 pieces of American cheese to three of the patties
        (one on each), and 3 pieces of the sharp cheddar to three burgers. Turn
        the heat off and cover the patties to let the cheese melt. Once the
        cheese is melted, stack 3 patties on top of each other, alternating
        cheese types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the patty stack to the prepared buns. Top with a few pickle
        slices, a drizzle of ketchup, mustard and special sauce. Serve
        immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the Onion Burger, repeat the same process with the bun and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Season the top of three ground beef balls with salt. Add them to the
        still-hot griddle, then cover each ball with a generous heap of onions.
        Place a heavy burger press onto each patty, compressing it down to ¼
        inch (.6 cm) thick. Cook each patty for 1 minute, or until deeply golden
        brown and lacy. Season the other side of the burger with salt, then flip
        the patty and cook for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat and add 3 pieces of
        American cheese to three of the patties (one on each), and 3 pieces of
        the sharp cheddar to three burgers. Turn the heat off and cover the
        patties to let the cheese melt. Once the cheese is melted, stack 3
        patties on top of each other, alternating cheese types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the patty stack to the prepared buns. Top with a few pickle
        slices, a drizzle of ketchup, mustard and special sauce. Serve
        immediately.
